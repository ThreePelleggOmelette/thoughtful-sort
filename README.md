# thoughtful-sort
The requested sort function

clone this repository and import the thoughtful-sort.py file. the function is _sort(length, width, height, mass)_.

The function only allows for float values to avoid unnecessary numeric checks and improve performance.

There is a single loop under the hood instead of using multiple any() calls.
